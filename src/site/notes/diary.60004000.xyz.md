## 🌐 Where am I?

Welcome to my personal **digital garden**! This is my unique space on the internet, inspired by the concept of _Digital Gardens in metric-driven social media_. Here, I share my thoughts, notes, and learnings on various topics, creating a living archive of my intellectual pursuits.

## 🧭 Navigating the Garden

**Exploration** is key in this digital space. Unlike traditional websites, this garden is organized through **bi-directional links** rather than chronological or alphabetical order. This non-linear structure encourages **curiosity-driven** navigation, using **Maps of Content (MOCs)** and a limited folder system to guide you from one idea to another, fostering a journey of discovery. So, feel free to wander and let your curiosity lead the way!
