### Where am I??

What you're on right now is a digital garden !

It's my little corner of the internet (see [The importance of digital gardens in metric-driven social media](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/the-importance-of-digital-gardens-in-metric-driven-social-media/)) where I publicly share my notes related to what I'm doing, what content I'm consuming, etc.

## How do I navigate this vault?

Digital gardens are websites organized by bi-directional links instead of by time or alphabetical order.

This means that rigid structures are not the main form of organization - you explore notes by hopping between links, Maps of Content (MOCs), and a limited folder system using your curiosity as your north star.
